# Auto Fold & Unfold for VS Code

This extension is under construction. Auto F&U automatically folds and unfolds when the cursor enters or leaves the function.

## How to install

```
code --install-extension levipires.auto-fold-unfold
```

## How to use

It's simple! You just need to place the cursor inside a function for it to open. And guess what happens if you leave the function!? Exactly!
It magically closes and puts miles of code under one line. It's a piece of cake.

## Requirements

This extension doesn't have any requirement. But in future releases, IntelliSense will be required.

## Limitations

* This is a under construction version. Please log any issues you find on [GitHub](https://github.com/levi-pires/auto-fold-unfold/issues).

* Due to bugs, the support for comment blocks was disabled.

* Support for tag hasn't been added yet.

* VS Code only executes the unfold command when the cursor is in the blue zone. I'm working on it so please don't open an issue to talk about it.
